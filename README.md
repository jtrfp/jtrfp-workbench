Getting started with the mtmx-workbench
========================================

The *mtmX Workbench* is a plug-in for the [Eclipse IDE](http://www.eclipse.org/).
It is used to edit and view files from the popular Terminal Reality games like Monster Truck Madness or their newest 
addition Ghostbusters.

## Installing Eclipse

I recommend using the Eclipse Classic SDK version for Windows.
This is what I'm using to test the plug-in.
Newer versions or non-Windows might work, or not...

[Download here](http://eclipse.org/downloads)

After downloading just unzip it and run the contained eclipse.exe. 
At its fist start Eclipse will ask to configure a workspace where all the settings and temporary files are stored.

You also need to have Java Runtime Environment (at least version 6) installed.

## Installing the mtmX Workbench plug-in

In the menu bar open *Help > Software Updates*. Under the *Available Software* tab click *Add site...* and add 
[http://update.stefanteitge.de](http://update.stefanteitge.de). After that expand the update site an select the *mtmX Workbench* feature. 
Finally click *Install...* and restart Eclipse.

## Adding a game

From menu bar *Window > Open Perspective > Other...* choose mtmX. Now the mtmX Workbench perspective will open. 
In *Window > Preferences > mtmX* you will be able to add all the installed Terminal Reality Games. 
After that you'll be able to browse and extract POD and many more files.
